# üìö Semantic Book Recommender using LLMs

A smart book recommendation system that understands **natural language queries** using **Hugging Face sentence embeddings**, **LangChain**, and **Chroma vector database** ‚Äî without relying on OpenAI APIs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîé **Semantic search**: Ask things like *"Books for kids who love animals"*
- ü§ñ **LLM-ready**: Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for deep semantic matching
- üß± **Vector DB**: Stores and retrieves documents via `Chroma`
- üß∞ **Modular**: Built with LangChain components for extensibility
- üñ•Ô∏è **Gradio UI** (optional): User-friendly interface for live querying

-Text data cleaning (code in the notebook data-exploration.ipynb)
-Semantic (vector) search and how to build a vector database (code in the notebook vector-search.ipynb). This allows users to find the most similar books to a natural language query (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").
-Doing text classification using zero-shot classification in LLMs (code in the notebook text-classification.ipynb). This allows us to classify the books as "fiction" or "non-fiction", creating a facet that users can filter the books on.
-Doing sentiment analysis using LLMs and extracting the emotions from text (code in the notebook sentiment-analysis.ipynb). This will allow users to sort books by their tone, such as how suspenseful, joyful or sad the books are.
-Creating a web application using Gradio for users to get book recommendations (code in the file gradio-dashboard.py).

# üìö Semantic Book Recommender using LLMs

A smart book recommendation system that understands **natural language queries** using **Hugging Face sentence embeddings**, **LangChain**, and **Chroma vector database** ‚Äî without relying on OpenAI APIs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîé **Semantic search**: Ask things like *"Books for kids who love animals"*
- ü§ñ **LLM-ready**: Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for deep semantic matching
- üß± **Vector DB**: Stores and retrieves documents via `Chroma`
- üß∞ **Modular**: Built with LangChain components for extensibility
- üñ•Ô∏è **Gradio UI** (optional): User-friendly interface for live querying

## üß™ Example Queries

Text data cleaning: Performed in data-exploration.ipynb, where raw book descriptions are cleaned and tagged for downstream processing.

Semantic vector search: Implemented in vector-search.ipynb, enabling users to find books similar to natural language queries (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").

Zero-shot text classification: Implemented in text-classification.ipynb, allowing classification of books into categories like fiction and non-fiction.

Sentiment analysis and emotion extraction: Found in sentiment-analysis.ipynb, enabling users to sort books by tone‚Äîsuch as suspenseful, joyful, or sad.

Gradio-powered web app: A user interface built in gradio-dashboard.py to allow interactive book recommendations based on user input.
